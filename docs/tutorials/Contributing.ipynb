    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a reasonably functioning \"dummy\" driver complete with tests at `https://github.com/dgjustice/ntc-rosetta/tree/dummy`.  This can be diffed against the origin at commit 994faaf1dbe894360477c3f55751587d82c5d368.  Test structure and code are constantly subject to change, so bear in mind that this is a snapshot in time and may not reflect the most recent changes to the project or any of its dependencies.  The [Makefile](https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-rosetta/blob/develop/Makefile) is the best sourse of truth for what is run during the test cycle.  \n",

    "Sphinx is run against the docs, so you will need to update the appropriate index.rst file ([example](https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-rosetta/blob/develop/docs/tutorials/index.rst)).  All jupyter notebooks are also run as part of the CI process, so additions and modifications need to run error-free.\n",

    "Refer to the Makefile and RTFM for the appropriate projects.  MyPy is utilized as well and has excellent [documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  A coverage report is generated locally by pytest, but it does not appear that this is being collected upstream just yet.\n",

    "Test cases are automatically collected based on a pre-determined file structure.  Refer to the test runner [source code](https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-rosetta/blob/develop/tests/models/test_models.py) for details.  Updating tests for existing models and drivers should be fairly self-explanatory if you refer to the source.  For new models and drivers, the setup is a little more involved.  The following structure must exist at a minimum and all the files need to be populated appropriately.  \n",
